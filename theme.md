# Theme Overview - Team 7 (Semester 1, 2023)

## Style.css
Within the style.css file, the CSS is mostly structured into three main parts: header, body, and footer. These parts are organized into separate classes and arranged accordingly. Any modifications to the theme's style should be made within this file.

To ensure easy identification for site users, we have made the button colours bright and contrasting against the background and other elements. The buttons are a vibrant red, serving as eye-catching calls to action and the first elements users notice. The body of the theme, where most of the text is displayed, features a white background. This enhances the legibility of dark text and directs the focus to the body content, including the calls to actions, as it has a striking visual separation from the header and footer.

## Typography
### Font
For TTCMA Inc, we used the serif font typeface "Rockwell", designed by Monotype Corporation for the majority of the website. This font is user-friendly, attractive, easy-to-read, and (as requested) "country styled".

## Header.php

## Footer.php
To make changes to the footer content (HTML, not CSS), you need to access the 'footer.php' file. The footer has been structured into three different content divisions (container, row, column) to align with the site's goals and emphasize separate links that serve different purposes. For example, the "About Club" page is separated from the contact links to make it more prominent, matching the dropdown menu for the "About Us" section in the site's header.  

To add new elements to the footer, you can include new links within each column using the "li" tag and turning them into links with "a". Alternatively, if you need a new section with multiple links, you can add an entirely new column using the column-footer class. Adjustments to the column widths would be made in the style.css file. The footer colour is the same as the header, #32373C (dark shade of cyan blue), creating a distinct contrast with the site body. It is a darker colour that helps highlight the calls to action within the body content.
