# Deployment - Team 7 (Semester 1, 2023)

# Project Management

We used a popular Project Management tool called "Trello" to delegate tasks and organize what tasks were undone, had to be done next, being worked on, and completed.
Once a task is moved to the "Next actions" tab, it's then assigned to each user, and then additional details that were relevant to the assigned task will be appended on.

Our method of communication is Discord, where we'd organize meetings, discuss our work, and any other need to communicate between members.

# Version Control

For all version control, we used Git for coordinated work among our team, and used the remote git server software, GitHub.

# Testing

For testing any changes, our workflow follows this guideline:
 - Local Testing
   - Ensure your Local Environment is up-to-date with the repository before working.
   - Make any developments on the Local Environment.
   - Test any changes you've made via opening your browser to LocalHost.
   - Once you're satisfied with your developments, push to the "Local" branch of the GitHub Repository.
 - Staging Testing
   - When you've made any changes to the Local Branch, it must then be tested on an online site, but not a publically-available site.
   - Navigate to Hostinger's backend, then to the Git tab under "Advanced" and deploy the updates from your "Local" branch repository into its file server.
   - Once the deployment is complete, you'll have to manually copy the files from your downloaded repository to the Wordpress folder, over-writing files with the updated files.
   - Assess the changes that you've made from the local environment, and compare to see if there's any fault.
   - If there's any issue, or if there's any changes you want to make, start over from the top of the guideline.
   - Once testing is complete, and you are satisfied, you can merge all changes into the "Main" branch.
